let age = 20;

// My initial solution
// console.log("In 10 years, you will be" + " " + Number (age +  10) + " " + "years old");
// console.log("In 20 years, you will be" + " " + Number (age +  20) + " " + "years old");
// console.log("In 30 years, you will be" + " " + Number (age +  30) + " " + "years old");
// console.log("In 40 years, you will be" + " " + Number (age +  40) + " " + "years old");    

//The better solution
console.log(`You are curently ${age} years old.`)
console.log(`In 10 years, you will be ${age + 10} years old.`)
console.log(`In 20 years, you will be ${age + 20} years old.`)
console.log(`In 30 years, you will be ${age + 30} years old.`)
console.log(`In 40 years, you will be ${age + 40} years old.`)
